Calunium is an Arduino clone using the ATmega164P, ATmega324P,
ATmega644, ATmega644P or ATmega1284P microcontroller. The layout is
designed for easy assembly and maximum compatibility with the Arduino
Uno, with additional functionality being compatible with the Arduino
Mega(2560).

Open-source designs for both PCB and strip board versions exist; the
pin mapping differs slightly for the analogue pins. The PCB version
includes an onboard real-time clock (DS1307).
